
Hi Dhananjay,

This is after we had tried deconfig and reconfig , we were getting permission issue. Following have resolved that.

1)  Issue was when root.sh being run on node1 it fails to copy few files to /u01/app/oracle/crsdata/. due to permission issue on both Nodes.
2)  Identified issue that the owner of this directory was changed to oracle:oinstall with recursive option.
3)  Fixed the permission issue on node 2 issue by manually changing owner as per the working node.
4)  Ran the root.sh script from node 1.
5)  This time it ran without any permission errors but in step 16 it failed to start evmd and other resources.
6)  Did a clean reboot after disabling cluster startup.
7)  Executed the root.sh script from node 1.
8) It again failed to start evmd and other resources.
9) We clean up all files present at path /u01/app/oracle/crsdata/droradbdr01/output  on Node 1.  Executed the root.sh script from node 1
10) Actual issue resolved after step no 9. However ,CRS services failed due to a voting disk discovery error.
11) Oracle support asked to provide logs for step # 9 issue.
12) We have uploaded the log files as required.
